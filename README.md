### Usage
1. yarn install
2. yarn start

### Considerations
Due to small size of the app, I have chosen only React to work with. As the project gets bigger and state gets harder to manage, I would implement Redux to manage the state and later on redux-saga to manage side-effects from async network calls.

### Learning Points
1. Forked a library (semantic-ui-react) to allow the progress bar percentage label to display more than 100%
